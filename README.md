# Activity Instructions

Create a Laravel route that utilizes all HTTP verbs (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE) and apply a token checker middleware to each route, ensuring that only requests with a valid token can access the routes. You can store the token value in the .env file. Test the functionality of each route using appropriate HTTP requests (e.g., GET for retrieving data, POST for creating data, etc.) and verify that the middleware successfully restricts access for requests without a valid token.
